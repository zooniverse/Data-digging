    "### Making sense of the stats output\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot of information here. Let's break it down.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Workflow information**\n",
    " -- The first thing the program prints is a list of all workflow IDs with at least one classification in the file, followed by the versions of those workflows (note, it doesn't match them up). This tells you what this export covers. The example \"My Project\" file has 3 workflows, with one version of each, but this can vary by project. \n",
    " \n",
    " 2. **Classification and Classifier counts, averages, medians**\n",
    " -- This is meant to give you a sense of who is classifying and how many classifications they're doing. The IP address count is meant to help you estimate how many of the not-logged-in classifiers are people who went to the project, started classifying, and logged in later (their not-logged-in classifications will have the same IP address and browser session). The difference between means and medians gives you a sense of how skewed the distributions of classifications (per classifier and per subject) are.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. **Top 10 most prolific classifiers**\n",
    " -- Leaderboards can be useful just to see who's doing what in your project, but *we do not recommend sharing them publicly* because they tend to encourage people to prioritize getting on the leaderboard, sometimes by sacrificing accuracy in favor of classifying fast. Plus, it may not be a great idea to imply that the people who classify the most are also the most valuable volunteers. However, this can be useful internally so you know who your most prolific classifiers are (they aren't always the people who post the most on Talk).\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. **Gini coefficient**\n",
    " -- The Gini coefficient measures inequality in distributions of things. It was originally conceived for economics (e.g. where is the wealth in a country? in the hands of many citizens or a few?), but it's just as applicable to many other fields. In this case we'll use it to see how classifications are distributed among classifiers.\n",
    " \n",
    " G = 0 is a completely even distribution (everyone does the same number of classifications), and ~1 is uneven (~all the classifications are done by one classifier). Typical values of the Gini for healthy Zooniverse projects (Cox et al. 2015) are in the range of 0.7-0.9. That range is generally indicative of a project with a loyal core group of  volunteers who contribute the bulk of the classification effort, but balanced out by a regular influx of new classifiers trying out the project, from which you continue to draw to maintain a core group of prolific classifiers. Once your project is fairly well established, you can compare it to past Zooniverse projects to see how you're doing.\n",
    " \n",
    " If your G is << 0.7, you may be having trouble recruiting classifiers into a loyal group of volunteers. People are trying it, but not many are staying. If your G is > 0.9, it's a little more complicated. If your total classification count is lower than you'd like it to be, you may be having trouble recruiting classifiers to the project, such that your classification counts are dominated by a few people. But if you have G > 0.9 and plenty of classifications, this may be a sign that your loyal users are -really- committed, so a very high G is not necessarily a bad thing.\n",
    "\n",
    " Of course the Gini coefficient is a simplified measure that doesn't always capture subtle nuances and so forth, but it's still a useful broad metric.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. **Classification dates and highest classification ID**\n",
    " -- It's useful to make sure your classification dates cover the time period you think they should, and the classification ID may be useful if you need to request a data export for just the most recent classifications since a given classification ID.\n",
    " \n",
    " 6. **File with user classification counts**\n",
    " -- This is always saved when you run the stats file, mainly because it's generated necessarily as a result of computing these stats, and it can come in handy for other things.\n",
    " \n",
    "Note, however, that these are only what the function prints *by default*, and in the default a lot of options are turned off. \n",
