# example_scripts

This is a temporary folder to perserve the URL integrity of scripts shared by
Zooniverse emails, up to the April 2020 script reorganisation. Please see the
[top-level README](../README.md) to learn where the other example scripts have
been organised to.

This folder currently contains only one file: 

- `check_for_duplicate_marks.py` - checks the Classifications export for a workflow with point-type drawing tasks to see if there are duplicate annotations. Created in response to [PFE issue 5527](https://github.com/zooniverse/Panoptes-Front-End/issues/5527) where annotations on touchscreen devices would be incorrectly created twice.

**This folder should be removed after May 2020**
